Version 0.6.0, 10/11/2001
	1. fix a bug in the construction of central potential, which
	   caused the potential at very large distances incorrect, this
	   bug did affected the results.
	2. fix another occasional failur in the Dirac Solver.
	3. implement paramatric fitting of collision strength.

Version 0.5.9, 10/05/2001
	1. reimplemented the transition radial integrals to better 
	   distinguish relativistic and non-relativistic approx.
	2. the relativistic multipole integrals are now interpolated
	   from a range of transition energies, in stead of using the
	   average, which seems to be not enough for M1 transitions

Version 0.5.8, 10/04/2001
	1. really fixed the occasionall failur of radial solver.
	2. the output level names are simplified by 
	   dropping the closed shells.
	3. fix the M1 transition rates. which should almost always 
	   use the relativistic expression. 
	
Version 0.5.7, 10/03/2001
	1. fix a bug in solving the radial orbital for the energy
	   initialization.
	2. added the [s,p,d] notation in the configuration 
	   specification. ie., 3[s,p] means a shell of either 
	   3s or 3p, so is 3[0,1].
	
Version 0.5.6, 10/01/2001
	1. fix the bug on the interpolation of PI and RR radial integrals
	2. change the implementation of ionization, so that it is 
    	   possible to use precomputed tables.
	
Version	0.5.5, 9/24/2001,
	1. Create the Package "pfac". Start Logging
