Version 0.5.8, 10/03/2001
	1. really fixed the occasionall failur of radial solver.
	2. the output level names are simplified by 
	   dropping the closed shells.
	
Version 0.5.7, 10/03/2001
	1. fix a bug in solving the radial orbital for the energy
	   initialization.
	2. added the [s,p,d] notation in the configuration 
	   specification. ie., 3[s,p] means a shell of either 
	   3s or 3p, so is 3[0,1].
	
Version 0.5.6, 10/01/2001
	1. fix the bug on the interpolation of PI and RR radial integrals
	2. change the implementation of ionization, so that it is 
    	   possible to use precomputed tables.
	
Version	0.5.5, 9/24/2001,
	1. Create the Package "pfac". Start Logging
