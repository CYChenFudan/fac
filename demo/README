In this directory. Li-like Fe is used as an example to demonstrate how to 
calculate the energy levels, collisional excitation, ionization, and 
recombination processes. 

fe24_level.py, the energy level and transitionrates.
fe24_exc.py, collisional excitation.
fe24_rr.py, photoionization and radiative recombination.
fe24_ion.py, collisional ionization.
fe24_dr.py, dielectronic recombination.
