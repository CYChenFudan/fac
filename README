FAC is a software packge for the calculation of various atomic processes.

Contents of the package:
Makefile,    top level makefile.
README,      this file.
setup.py,    setup script for Python interface.
blas/,       BLAS routines in fortran.
coul/,       fortran routines related to coulomb functions.
demo/,       some demo scripts.
doc/,        reference guide for FAC
doc/papers/, papers submitted to Computer Phys. Comm.
faclib/,     core numerical library.
lapack/,     fortran routines from LAPACK.
minpack/,    minpack optimization package.
mpfunc/,     multi-precision floating point arithmetic package by Beiley.
python/,     python interface.
sfac/,       non-python interface.
toms/,       some numerical routines from TOMS.

INSTALL:
1. Obtain (From www.python.org) and install Python if it is not installed yet
   and the python interface is needed. 
   Version 2.0 or later is required. Make sure that python interpreter is 
   in your path.

2. Choose the appropriate Makefile and make possible adjustments 
   according to your system. Currently, only 2 Makefiles exist, one for 
   Sun Solaris systems, one for Linux. However, It should be relatively 
   simple to modify them to fit other Unix systems.

3. copy the approriate "Makefile.***" to "Makefile" and 
	make sfac
	make pyfac
	make install
   skip "make pyfac" if python is not available. The building requires 
   GNU make. 
   

Usage:
The module can be called just like any python modules, either from 
interpreter interactively, or pass the script to python. 
e.g., python fe24_level.py,

The non-python interface produces an executable "sfac", accepting input 
files as arguments.
