\section{What Is FAC}
FAC stands for The Flexible Atomic Code (and nothing else). It is an
integrated software package to calculate various atomic radiative and
collisional processes, including energy levels, radiative transition rates,
collisional excitation and 
ionization by electron impact, photoionization, autoionization, radiative
recombination and dielectronic capture. The package also includes a
collisional radiative model to construct synthetic spectra for plasmas under
different physical conditions. The various parts of FAC and their
interactions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:flow}. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=6in]{flow.eps}
\caption{\label{fig:flow}The overview of FAC package.}
\end{figure}

The atomic structure calculation in FAC is based on the relativistic
configuration interaction with independent particle basis wavefunctions. These
basis wavefunctions are derived from a local central potential, which is
self-consistently determined to represent electronic screening of the nuclear
potential. Relativistic effects are fully taken into account using the Dirac
Coulomb Hamiltonian. Higher order QED effects are presently ignored, which may
limit its accuracy for very high-$Z$ elements. Continuum processes are treated
in the distorted-wave (DW) approximation. Systematic application of the
factorization-interpolation method of \citet{barshalom88} makes the present
code highly efficient for large scale calculations. The details of theoretical
background and computational methods are not discussed in this manual, in
stead, they are described in a series of papers which are distributed along
with this package and this manual.

FAC is a step forward to bring detailed atomic model accessable to a wide
community of laboratory and astrophysical plasma diagnostics. Its flexible
interface is designed to be useful even for people without a deep
understanding of the underlying atomic theories. It is also powerful enough
for experieced users to explore the effects of algorithmic choices and
different physical approximations.

FAC is freely distributed in the hope that it will be useful. The author makes
every effort to ensure its correctness. However, he does not guarantee its
fitness to any specific purpose. The author is not responsible for any damage
resulting from the use of this program, including failure to obtain or loss of
tenure. 

\section{Obtain and Install FAC}
\index{Install}
\label{sec:install}
The latest version of FAC is \facversion. It can be obtained from anounymous
ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/mfgu/fac/. I can also send a copy to you through
email. Please request to \textbf{mfgu@space.mit.edu}. It is being continously
developed at present, so please check regularly to get the newest version. 

Much of the FAC package is written in ANSI C and Fortran 77. It should 
therefore work on any platform with a C and Fortran 77 compilers. However, 
this is only true to the rather simple command parser come with FAC, referred 
to as SFAC. The flexibility of FAC is realized when the Python interface
(PFAC)is used. The numerical subroutines implemented in FAC are exported
through several Python modules. The computation task can therefore be
completed by programming in the scripting language Python. These python
modules are compiled as shared objects, and are dynamically loaded. This
primarily works under ELF systems, such as almost all modern Unix and Linux
systems. It has also been tested to work under Mac OS X and Windows (In the
case of Windows, the Unix API emulation by Cygwin is required, which is
available at \textbf{www.cygwin.com}). To fully utilize the strength of  
FAC, it is strongly recommended that Python be installed, which can be obtained
from \textbf{www.python.org}.

In all Unix-like systems with Python installed, the installation of FAC 
uses the \verb|distutil| module comes with Python. To install in the standard 
location, download FAC from the above mentioned ftp site, gunzip and extract 
from the tar-ball, change to the top directory and type 
\begin{verbatim}
    python setup.py install
    python setup.py sfac
\end{verbatim}
where the first command installs the Python package \verb|pfac| which 
contains several Python and extension modules, and the second command
installs the SFAC interface in your \verb|${HOME}/bin|.

Without Python, one may install the SFAC interface by 
\begin{verbatim}
    make sfac
    make install
\end{verbatim}
This will place two excutables, \verb|sfac| and \verb|scrm|, in your 
\verb|${HOME}/bin|.

The system must have a \verb|make| compartible with GNU \verb|make|, even if
\verb|setup.py| is used, since this script calls \verb|make| to compile the
libraries. One should check out the README file in the top directory of FAC 
distribution for more instructions.

\section{Quick Start}
\label{sec:start}
\subsection{SFAC Interface}
The SFAC interface is basically a stripped down command interpreter modeled
after Python syntax, with the omission of flow control freatures, such as
conditional execution and loops. Therefore simple Python scripts may be
converted to SFAC input files without difficulty. The Python interface
actually contains functions to do the convertion automatically. Through out
this manuall, we mainly focus on the more useful Python interface. Most of the
Python fuctions implemented in the extension modules are also available in
SFAC interface with identical calling sequences. To use SFAC, one passes the
input files to the two executables \verb|sfac| and \verb|scrm| on the command
line such as 
\begin{verbatim}
    sfac input.sf
    scrm input.sf
\end{verbatim}
or, one may invoke \verb|sfac| and \verb|scrm| without arguments, in which
case, they read from \verb|stdin| for inputs, where commands are interpreted
line by line. The program \verb|sfac| handles atomic calculations, while
\verb|scrm| is used to construct collisional radiative spectral models.

\subsection{PFAC Interface}
To use the PFAC interface, one needs to be familiar with the basics of Python
scripting language. Python has excellent documentations come with the standard
distribution. It is an extremely well designed language to learn, and to use.

Perhaps, the quickest way to get familiar with FAC is to inspect the simple
demo scripts in the \verb|demo/| directory comes with FAC distribution. There
are individual scripts and their SFAC conterparts demonstrating the
calculation of energy levels, radiative transition rates, collisional
excitation and ionization cross sections, radiative recombination cross
sections and autoionization rates. There is also a more advanced example for
the calculation of iron L-shell atomic data, and their application in the
collisional radiative model.

In this section, we look into the details of one of these scripts,
\verb|demo/structure/fe17_structure.py| for the calculation of Ne-like iron
energy levels and radiative transition rates between $n = 2$ and $n = 3$
complexes. The following is a duplication of that script.
\begin{verbatim}
 1: from pfac import fac

 2: fac.SetAtom('Fe')
 3: # 1s shell is closed
 4: fac.Closed('1s')
 5: fac.Config('2*8', group = 'n2')
 6: fac.Config('2*7 3*1', group = 'n3')

 7: # Self-consistent iteration for optimized central potential
 8: fac.ConfigEnergy(0)
 9: fac.OptimizeRadial(['n2', 'n3'])
10: fac.ConfigEnergy(1)
11: fac.Structure('ne.lev.b', ['n2', 'n3'])
12: fac.MemENTable('ne.lev.b')
13: fac.PrintTable('ne.lev.b', 'ne.lev', 1)

14: fac.TransitionTable('ne.tr.b', ['n2'], ['n3'])
15: fac.PrintTable('ne.tr.b', 'ne.tr', 1)
\end{verbatim}
Line numbers are added for easy reference, they are not part of the script. 
As is evident from the above list, all functions implemented in the FAC
extension modules have a naming convention of concatenated capitalized words.
Line 1 imports the extension module \verb|fac| from the package \verb|pfac|.
Alternatively, one could have used
\begin{verbatim}
    from pfac.fac import *
\end{verbatim}
then, all module qualifiers \verb|fac.| in the following lines can be omitted.
Line 2 set the atomic element to be iron. Line 3 is a comment, which starts
with a \verb|#|. Line 4--6 specifies the electronic configurations to be
included in the calculation. The closed shells specified by the function
\verb|Closed| must be inactive in this calculation. In the \verb|Config|
functions, \verb|2*8| stands for an $n = 2$ complexes with 8 electrons, while
\verb|2*7 3*1| stands for all configurations resulting from excitation of one
electron from $n = 2$ to $n = 3$. For more possibilities in the specification
of electronic configurations, one is referred to Chapter \ref{cha:function}.
Line 8--10 carries out a Dirac-Fock-Slater self-consistent calculation to
derive a local central potential which represents the electronic screening of
the nuclear potential. In this calculation, the potential is optimized to the
average electron clouds of configurations \verb|n2| and \verb|n3|, since in
FAC, all atomic processes are treated with basis wavefunctions generated from
a single potential. This
results in the potential to be less optimized for \verb|n2| and \verb|n3|
individually. Lines 8 and 10 are used to make a crude correction to the
resulting energy levels due to this effect. The first call to
\verb|ConfigEnergy(0)| will make individual optimization to all configuration
groups. The average energy of each configuration is then calculated and stored
under the potentials optimized for each configuration groups. The second call
to \verb|ConfigEnergy(1)| will then recalculate the average energy of
configurations under the potential taking into account all configuration
groups. The difference between the two represents the effect of a less
optimized potential, and are used to adjust the final energy levels. If this
procedure is not needed, one can omit line 8 and 10 in this script. Line 11
sets up the Hamiltonian matrix for levels in $n = 2$ and $n = 3$ complexes,
diagonalize it, and saves to the energy level information in the binary file
\verb|ne.lev.b|. Line 12 builds an in-memory table of energy levels, which is
used to convert the binary files to their ASCII counterparts in verbose mode,
such as done in Line 13, which converts \verb|ne.lev.b| to \verb|ne.lev| (the
last argument to \verb|PrintTable| indicates it be done in verbose mode). For
the conversion in simple mode (the last argument is 0), the in-memory table is
not needed, and Line 12 may be omitted. For the difference between the verbose
and simple ASCII files, see Chapter \ref{cha:format}. Line 14 calculates the
E1 oscillator strength and transition rates between cofiguration groups
\verb|n2| and \verb|n3|, and saves the results in the binary file
\verb|ne.tr.b|. The function \verb|TransitionTable| accepts an optional 4th
integer argument specifying the transition type. A negative integer means
electric multipol and a positive integer for magnetic multipole. The absolute
value of the integer indicates the rank of the multipole. Therefore, $-1$ would
be E1, $+1$ would be M1, etc. Without this argument, the default is E1, as is
done here. Line 15 converts the binary output to an ASCII file in verbose
mode. The exact formats of binary and ASCII files are explained in Chapter
\ref{cha:format}. Here we list the two ASCII files \verb|ne.lev| and
\verb|ne.tr| resulted from this calculation.

\chapter{Description of Output Files}
\label{cha:format}
The primary output files of FAC are in binary format. The I/O functionality
and the conversion from binary to ASCII format are implemented in the source
files \verb|faclib/dbase.h| and \verb|faclib/dbase.c|. In this chapter, we
describe the structure of these files in detail.

\section{Binary Format}
\label{sec:binary}
\index{Binary format}
Presently, FAC produces 8 different types of files. Each type is asigned
a unique integer from 1--8, which corresponds to a macro define in the file
\verb|faclib/dbase.h|. These types are
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{DB\_EN = 1}] Energy levels produced by the function
\verb|fac.Structure|. 
\item[\texttt{DB\_TR = 2}] Radiative transition rates produced by
\verb|fac.TransitionTable|.
\item[\texttt{DB\_CE = 3}] Collisional excitation cross sections produced by
\verb|fac.CETable|. 
\item[\texttt{DB\_RR = 4}] Radiative recombination and photoionization cross
sections produced by \verb|fac.RRTable|.
\item[\texttt{DB\_AI = 5}] Autoionization rates produced by \verb|fac.AITable|.
\item[\texttt{DB\_CI = 6}] Collisional ionization cross sections produced by
\verb|fac.CITable|. 
\item[\texttt{DB\_SP = 7}] Spectral line strengths produced by
\verb|crm.SpecTable|. 
\item[\texttt{DB\_RT = 8}] Various population rates produced by
\verb|crm.RateTable|. 
\end{description}

All files have a common structure. It consists of a file header and one or
more data blocks. Each data block is comprised of a data header and one or
more data records. In the following, we show the C definition of all structs
and describe each field in detail. When one field is a pointer, it means that
an array is saved in the database. The pointer points to the memory location
where the data is stored. The value of the pointer itself is also
saved in the file followed by the data stored in the array. Obviously, the
saved pointer itself has no meaning once the program exits (since it is a
memory location), it is saved for the sake of convenience. When reading out
the data from the database file, these pointer values should be ignored.

\subsection{\texttt{F\_HEADER}}
\index{\texttt{F\_HEADER}}
\texttt{F\_HEADER} is the file header common to all data files. 

\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct _F_HEADER_ {
  long  tsession;
  int   version;
  int   sversion;
  int   ssversion;
  int   type;
  float atom;
  char  symbol[4];
  int   nblocks;
} F_HEADER;
\end{verbatim}

\begin{dbdesc}
\item[\texttt{long tsession}:] Time stamp when the file is created. This is the
value returned by the C lib function time(0). It is platform dependent. 
\item[\texttt{int version}:] Major version number of FAC.
\item[\texttt{int sversion}:] Minor version number of FAC.
\item[\texttt{int ssversion}:] Release number of FAC.
\item[\texttt{int type}:] Type of the data file. An integer from 1--8.
\item[\texttt{float atom}:] Atomic number.
\item[\texttt{char symbol[4]}:] The first 3 bytes contains a NULL
terminated C string representing the 2-charactor abbr. of atomic symbol. The
4th byte is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the platform stores data in
liitle or big endian.
\item[\texttt{int nblocks}:] Number of data blocks in this file.
\end{dbdesc}

\subsection{\texttt{EN\_HEADER}}
\index{\texttt{EN\_HEADER}}
\texttt{EN\_HEADER} is the data header for energy level data blocks.

\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct _EN_HEADER_ {
  long position;
  long length;
  int nele;
  int nlevels;
} EN_HEADER;

CB mode, the radial integrals are obtained by looking up a table of
Coulomb-Born-Exchange results from \citet{golden77,golden80}, which is very
fast. In DW mode, the integrals are calculated using the distorted-wave

related to the ionization cross section as (in atomic units):

\end{equation}
where ${k_0}$ is the kinetic momentum of the incident electron, and $g_0$ is

\item[\texttt{int iblock}:] The index of the superlevel block from which the
rates originate.
\item[\texttt{float nb}:] The concentration of the superlevel block from which
the rates originate.
\item[\texttt{float tr}:] The radiative transition rates.

\textbf{N.B.:} The last 3 records of each rate block have different
meanings. The \texttt{iblock} index of these 3 entries are $-1$, $-2$, $-3$
respectively. Fot \texttt{iblock} = $-1$, \texttt{nb} is the total density of
the ion which has one less electron than the one this superlevel block belongs
to. \texttt{tr} is always 0.0. \texttt{ce} is always 0.0. \texttt{rr} is the
the total radiative recombination rates to this superlevel block. \texttt{ai}
is the total dielectronic capture rates to this superlevel
block. \texttt{icomplex} is the number of electrons of the higher charge state
converted to string. For \texttt{iblock} = $-2$, \texttt{nb} is the total
density of the ion. \texttt{tr} is the total radiative transition rates to
this superlevel block. \texttt{ce} is the total collisional excitation rates
to this superlevel block. \texttt{rr} is always 0.0. \texttt{ai} is the part
of total autoionization rates that originated from this ion, i.e., the
resonant excitation rates. \texttt{icomplex} is the number of electrons of
this ion converted to a string. For \texttt{iblock} = $-3$, \texttt{nb} is the
total density of the ion with one more electron this one. \texttt{tr} is
always 0.0. \texttt{ce} is always 0.0. \texttt{rr} is the total
photoionization rates to this superlevel block. \texttt{ai} is the part of
total autoionization rates that originated from the lower charge state, i.e.,
the inner-shell excitation of the lower charge state which results in the
autoionization, or excitation-autoionization.

\section{ASCII Format}
\index{ASCII Format}
FAC provides functions to convert the binary output to ASCII files. There are
two types of ASCII formats, a simple translation of binary files and a more
verbose version that adds more derived information for the sake of
convenience. If the ASCII files are created to be human-readable, the
verbose form should be used.

In the simple form, the contents of binary files are converted to ASCII format
as is. No additional information is added. All physical values are in atomic
units as is in binary files. The different byte-order used by different
platforms are taken into account automatically. Therefore, it is possible to
create the binary files on a little endian machine (probably faster), then
convert them to ASCII format on a slower big endian machine.

In the verbose form, the more common units of physical quanties are
used. Specifically, s$^{-1}$ for transition rates, 10$^{-20}$ cm$^2$ for cross
sections, and eV for energies. For data files other than \texttt{DB\_EN} type,
the energies and angular momenta of the levels involved in the processes are
not included in the binary version. In the verbose form of corresponding ASCII
files, these infomations are added by looking up in the energy level
table. Also, for \texttt{DB\_TR} files, not only $gf$ values, but radiative
transition rates are tabulated. For \texttt{DB\_CE} and \texttt{DB\_CI}, cross
sections are tabulated along with the collision strengths. For \texttt{DB\_RR},
radiative recombination and photionization cross sections are tabulated along
with the bound-free differential $gf$ values. For \texttt{DB\_AI}, the energy
integrated dielectronic capture strengths (in unit of 10$^{-20}$ eV cm$^2$)
are tabulated in addition to the autoionization rates.

In the following sections, a portion of each type of database file in the
verbose form is listed and significant fields explained. The lines start with
a ``\verb|#|'' are the added explanation, which are not part of the output
file. These files are generated with the scipts in the \texttt{demo/}
directory come with FAC.

\chapter{FAC Function Reference}
\label{cha:function}
\index{Functions}
This chapter describes the functions available in the PFAC interface which are
organized in the package named \mod{pfac}. Each
python module is documented in a separate section, where the global variables,
functions, classes are listed in alphabatic order. Most functions in the
extension modules \mod{fac} and \mod{crm} are also available in SFAC interface
with identical calling syntax using the two executables \mod{sfac} and
\mod{scrm}. Their usage in SFAC interface is therefore not documented
separately. Functions and classes of other python modules are generally not
implemented in SFAC interface. In the documentation of each function, the
arguments in brackets are optional, and keyword arguments are indicated by
\var{key=arg} pair.

\section{\mod{fac}--Core FAC module}
\label{sec:fac}
\index{\mod{fac}}
\subsection{Variables}
There are several global variables one may make use of.
\begin{vardesc}{VERSION}
This is a string representing the version of FAC. It is in the form of
\var{major.minor.release}, where \var{major}, \var{minor}, and \var{release}
are numbers.
\end{vardesc}
\begin{vardesc}{ATOMICSYMBOL}
This is a list of strings representing the atomic symbols of all elements in
the periodic table. The first element of this list is empty. Therefore 
\key{ATOMICSYMBOL[i]} is for atom with nuclear charge equal to \key{i}.
\end{vardesc}

\subsection{Functions}
The module contains the following functions.
\begin{fundesc}{SetAtom}{asym\opt{, z\opt{, m}}}
This function set the atomic element to \var{asym}, where \var{asym} is the
standard elemental symbol. The nuclear charge \var{z} and atomic mass \var{m}
of the element can be set optionally. If they are not set, the standard values
are used.
\end{fundesc}
