   Version 1.5 or later is required. Make sure that python interpreter is 
   in your path.

2. Choose the appropriate Makefile and make possible adjustments 
   according to your system. Currently, only 2 Makefiles exist, one for 
   Sun Solaris systems, one for Linux. However, It should be relatively 
   simple to modify them to fit other Unix systems.

   "make; make install"
