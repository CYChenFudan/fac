Version 0.7.0, 02/06/2002
	1. add endian swapping in dbase.c and crm.c
	2. implement extrapolation on recombined states.
	3. using Seaton's method (MNRAS 119, 81) to extrapolate RR rates
	4. adding the ionization balance calculation of Arnaud&Raymond.

Version 0.6.9, 01/20/2002
	1. improve the atom module.
	2. updated demo scripts for the new version. added the FeL 
	   demo scripts to calculate the FeL spectrum.
	3. changed the default QkMode for excitation to EXACT.
	4. added SetAbund routine to CRM.

Version 0.6.8, 01/14/2002
	1. use setup.py script to install the python interface. 
	   successfully built under Windows with Cygwin installed.
	2. implement binary output, and its conversion to ASCII format.
	3. changed the argument order of *Table routines, and the routine
	   Structure. The first argument of these routines are now always 
	   the output file name. The routine "LevelTable" is removed. 
	   The file name for the energy levels are now supplied to the 
	   routine "Structure" as the first argument. Several "Structure"
	   calls may share the same output file.
	4. implement ATOM class in "pfac.atom" module. wrote the function
	   "pfac.atom.atomic_data()" for systematic calculation of all
	   K-shell and L-shell processes.
	5. fix a bug in RR, which produced nonsence for n > 10, when
	   hydrogenic approximation is used for them.
	6. implement a collisional radiative model for the construction
	   of spectra. It is implemented in a separate python module 
	   "pfac.crm", and the corresponding simple interface "scrm".
	7. improved the fitting formula for collisonal excitation.
	   the original one fails in some cases. the current one seems
	   to be much better.

Version 0.6.7, 12/01/2001
	1. fix the bug in RR, which causes seg. fault.

Version 0.6.6, 11/06/2001
	1. Implement the non-python interface "sfac". Its input file
	   closely resembles the python scripts, without the flow 
	   control constructs. 
	2. the module "config" is now depricated. "config.config()" 
	   should be replaced with "fac.Config()". "config.closed()"
	   with "fac.Closed()", and "config.avgconfig()" with 
	   "fac.AvgConfig()". 
	
Version 0.6.5, 11/04/2001
	1. Implement the Binary-Encouter-Dipole model for ionization.
	2. Separate contributions from individual shells in the output
	   for photoionization and EII.
	3. Calculate the Bethe limit for EIE and EII, ensuring the correct
	   asymptotic behavior at high energies.

Version 0.6.4, 10/25/2001
	1. adding minpack routines. use an improved version of fitting
	   formula for PI cross sections.
	2. Increased the default radial grid points from 420 to 500. 
	   the original grid wasn't quite enough for RR onto high orbital
	   angular momentum states.
	3. implement hydrogenic approximtion of RR and PI cross sections
	   for high-n and high-L states. By default, states with n >= 6
	   are calculated in hydrogenic approximation. this can be changed
	   by SetHydrogenicNL(). 
	
Version 0.6.3, 10/22/2001
	1. allow the use of CBO approximation in the collisional
	   ionization calculation. 
	2. allow the specification of energy grid limits for automatic
	   construction via SetPEGridLimits(min, max) etc.
	3. fitting of EIE collision strength is abandoned, in favor of
	   interpolation, which is more reliable. 
	
Version 0.6.2, 10/19/2001
	1. the fitting of RR cross sections doesn't work quite well, 
	   changed back to interpolation.
	2. added routine to prepare and load ionization Qk tables.
	
Version 0.6.1, 10/13/2001
	1. change the default angz_cut t0 1E-3, which seem to be adequate
	   and makes the calculation much more efficient for large scale 
	   problems. added SetAngZCut and SetMixCut routines.
	2. allow multipole closed shells to be specified on one call to 
	   config.closed().
	3. add Makefile to python/
	
Version 0.6.0, 10/12/2001
	1. fix a bug in the construction of central potential, which
	   caused the potential at very large distances incorrect, this
	   bug did not affected the results.
	2. fix another occasional failur in the Dirac Solver.
	3. implemented the paramatric fitting of collision strength,
	   RR cross sections and ionization cross sections.

Version 0.5.9, 10/05/2001
	1. reimplemented the transition radial integrals to better 
	   distinguish relativistic and non-relativistic approx.
	2. the relativistic multipole integrals are now interpolated
	   from a range of transition energies, in stead of using the
	   average, which seems to be not enough for M1 transitions

Version 0.5.8, 10/04/2001
	1. really fixed the occasionall failur of radial solver.
	2. the output level names are simplified by 
	   dropping the closed shells.
	3. fix the M1 transition rates. which should almost always 
	   use the relativistic expression. 
	
Version 0.5.7, 10/03/2001
	1. fix a bug in solving the radial orbital for the energy
	   initialization.
	2. added the [s,p,d] notation in the configuration 
	   specification. ie., 3[s,p] means a shell of either 
	   3s or 3p, so is 3[0,1].
	
Version 0.5.6, 10/01/2001
	1. fix the bug on the interpolation of PI and RR radial integrals
	2. change the implementation of ionization, so that it is 
    	   possible to use precomputed tables.
	
Version	0.5.5, 9/24/2001,
	1. Create the Package "pfac". Start Logging
